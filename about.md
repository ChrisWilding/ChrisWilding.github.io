Hi, I'm Chris Wilding. I'm a music loving, tea obsessed software developer
living and working in Manchester, UK.

Some of the languages, software and tools I work with regularly are: AWS,
CSS/SCSS, Docker, Git, GitHub, JavaScript, Jira, IntelliJ, Linux, macOS,
Node.js, Python, React, Redux, Scala, Terraform, and Visual Studio Code.

In the past I've also worked with: Capybara, CentOS, Cucumber, Elixir, Express,
GraphQL, MySQL, RSpec, Rails, Ruby, SQL, Sinatra, Troposphere, Ubuntu, Vagrant
and Vim.

In my spare time I love trying out new languages and tools.
