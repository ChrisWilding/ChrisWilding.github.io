Hi, I'm Chris Wilding. I'm a music loving, tea obsessed software developer
living and working in Manchester, UK.

Some of the languages, software and tools I work with regularly are: AWS,
CSS/SCSS, CentOS, Express, Git, GitHub, JavaScript, Jira, Linux, macOS,
Node.js, Python, React, Redux, Troposphere, and Vim

In the past I've also worked with: Capybara, Cucumber, Elixir, GraphQL, MySQL,
RSpec, Rails, Ruby, SQL, Sinatra, Ubuntu, and Vagrant

In my spare time I love trying out new languages and tools. I'd love to work
commercially with a functional programming language like Erlang or Elixir. I
really enjoying working with Go on personal projects. I'm also enjoying working
with DevOps tools like Docker and Terraform.
